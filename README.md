# BiVector

## Decription

Sorry for that this is just a toy from which I learn how to make a ruby gem.

Here I provide a quite simple 2D vector class, and some methods to deal with the basic mathematical calculations between bivectors.

## Install

`gem install bivector`

## Test

To run the tests: `$ rake test`
